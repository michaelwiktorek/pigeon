This is a short specification document that defines an interface for a Pigeon GUI.

A GUI for Pigeon must provide the following functions:

sys_write(message):
	write a message to a system-output display in the format "SYSTEM: [message]"

chat_write(message, name):
	write a message to a chat-history display in the format "[name]: [message]"

chat_notify(message):
	write a message to a chat-history display in the format "SYSTEM: [message]"

print_userlist(userlist):
	print a dict {addr:username} in a userlist display in the form "username: addr"

send_blank():
	send the controller a blank string. Only used if HANDLES_MAIN_LOOP is true

get_text():
	return a string typed into the chat box by the user
	Note: might need to be changed if HANDLES_MAIN_LOOP

start_gui(controller):
	startup function. This can be a dummy function, but other functions must work after it is called

end_gui():
	ending function. This can be a dummy function, but the gui must die after it is called

bool: HANDLES_MAIN_LOOP
      True: the gui handles the main loop
      False: the controller handles the main loop
      
main_loop():
	handles the input loop, if HANDLES_MAIN_LOOP is True
