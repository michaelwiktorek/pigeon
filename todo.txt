Stuff to implement:

DONE:
user names 
allow continued use after closing gui 
better way of quitting gui program  
config file with name 
add upnp support for good P2P functionality
make sure the server gets the proper ip address
add per-session RSA encryption to messaging
refactor pigeon_gui (modular gui is possible now!)
stop program from crashing when you resize the terminal (kind of)
write tkinter gui, allows scrolling, long messages
rewrite server code to use TCP/select
stop requiring "enter" to end convo in tkinter (kind of)
send other user new name when you rename during conversation

TODO:
store list of names/ips
handle receiving long strings (bigger than 2048 bits?)

WILD'N'CRAZY:
chat with multiple users at once


Bugs:

connect fail bug:  
	other end connects, you hangup, you cannot reach other end anymore
	can't figure this one out, maybe a join time issue?
	still a problem
	this bug seems to disappear after waiting for ten seconds or so

resize breaks curses gui:
       happens on cygwin and over ssh

upnp failure:
     upnp device discovery is inconsistent
     figure out multicast?
