Stuff to implement:

DONE:
user names 
allow continued use after closing gui 
better way of quitting gui program  
config file with name 
add upnp support for good P2P functionality
make sure the server gets the proper ip address
add per-session RSA encryption to messaging
refactor pigeon_gui (modular gui is possible now!)
stop program from crashing when you resize the terminal (kind of)

TODO:
allow typing box to expand  [maybe impossible]
add scrolling of text history
store list of names/ips
handle receiving long strings (bigger than 2048 bits?)
write new gui that doesn't use curses

WILD'N'CRAZY:
chat with multiple users at once


Bugs:

connect fail bug:  
	other end connects, you hangup, you cannot reach other end anymore
	can't figure this one out, maybe a join time issue?
	still a problem
	this bug seems to disappear after waiting for ten seconds or so



rsa chat length:     DONE
    	long message becomes gibberish, calculate length and break up message

resize window bug:  DONE, pretty well at least
       fatal program crash when window is resized
       still crashes the curses gui on Cygwin
