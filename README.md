# pigeon

The absolutely awful chat program.

Pigeon is a cute little chat program written in Python with a curses GUI. It comes packaged with a simple registration server that track and communicate a list of online users, but its messaging system operates on a strictly peer-to-peer basis and does not need the server to operate.

To run the program, type "python main.py".
To run the server, type "python server.py".

At this moment Pigeon does not support chatting with multiple other users at once. It also does not support UPnP, so you may need to forward ports if your client or server are running behind a router.
