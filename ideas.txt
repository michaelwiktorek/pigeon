structure of the program:

GUI class
    public screen?
    Receiver knows about GUI, can write to its screen
    
forget all the garbage I thought up before

Connector class:
asks: wait for connection or attempt to connect?
either way, establishes a TCP connection

once we have a connection (socket), spin up two threads
Sender, waits on the send queue and writes messages from it to the socket
Receiver, waits on the socket, writes messages from it to either a GUI queue or the display_pad

Also, once we have a connection, start the GUI and begin printing/taking input

this is the correct structure, I am sure of it
